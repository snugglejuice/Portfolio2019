          The KLAP project is an approach to help students add value to their experiences
          with the learning portfolio. A learning portfolio is a tool which allow stidents
          to keep marks of their learning ( work, video, projects ) in order to prove the
          acquisition of skills. This portfolio allow to summarize and demonstrate skills
          and experiences to a teacher or a future employer.
        </p>
        <p class="project__content__text">
          Our job was to gamify the learning portfolio process to help students undertand
          the interest of building this kind of portfolio.

          Why are students reluctant to build their <span class="underline">learning portfolio</span> ?
        </h2>
        <p class="project__content__text">
          As a design and multimedia student, I got my own idea about what is a portfolio but a learning portfolio is different. That's why
          the first step to enter in the project was to understand : what is a learning portfolio ? Why teachers encourage students to build
          this kind of portfolio ? What are the benefits of such portfolio ? and why are the student reluctant to build one ?

                <h3 class="project__content__title">The Problem</h3>
                <p class="project__content__text">
                  After learning more informations about the learning portfolio, the two other students and me decided to interview some students
                  to understand why they don't manage or don't want to create a learning portfolio ?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="body__row__container">
                <h3 class="project__content__title">Interview answers</h3>
                <p class="project__content__text">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Most of the students answered that they don't understand the benefits of the learning portfolio </li>
                    <li>Some students don't know how to prove their skills</li>
                    <li>Most of the students create a learning portfolio because it's required for graduate </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="project__content__text">
          We conclude that as most of students don't understand the benefit of the learning portfolio, they do it at the last minutes and only for the grade.
          Nevertheless, doing it at the last moment don't allow them to collect proofs of their experiences and to reflect on them. That's why most of the learning
          portfolio are bad.
