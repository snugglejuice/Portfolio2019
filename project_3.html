          The KLAP project is an approach <span class="highlight">to help students add value to their experiences

          to keep marks of their learning ( work, video, projects ) in order to prove the
          acquisition of skills. This portfolio allow to summarize and demonstrate skills
          and experiences to a teacher or a future employer.

          As a design and multimedia student, I got my own idea about what is a portfolio but a learning portfolio is different. That's why
          <span class="highlight">the first step to enter in the project was to understand : what is a learning portfolio ? </span>Why teachers encourage students to build
          this kind of portfolio ? What are the benefits of such portfolio ? and why are the student reluctant to build one ?

                  After learning more informations about the learning portfolio, the two other students and me decided to interview some students
                  to understand why they don't manage or don't want to create a learning portfolio ?

                    <li>Some students don't know how to prove their skills</li>

          We conclude that as <span class="highlight">most of students don't understand the benefit of the learning portfolio, they do it at the last minutes and only for the grade.</span>
          Nevertheless, doing it at the last moment don't allow them to collect proofs of their experiences and to reflect on them. That's why most of the learning
          portfolio are bad.

          Our first idea was to create an online phone game. With this, students could play and understand the principles of the learning Portfolio
          from anywhere on their phone. Nevertheless, we left this idea really fast. Indeed, as students don't understand the benefit, we thought that
          they will not make the step to learn about it on their own. Instead, they should be guided by a professor who can answer their questions and tell
          them the benefit. So we conclude that  <span class="highlight">a boardgame leading by a teacher as a game master</span> will be a better option.

          <span class="underline">The process</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="project__content__text">
          The game design journey has begin in November 2018 with a game jam organized by Reine Nguo-Ngue.
          She invited all the team but also other students. During this game jam we have created different prototypes which were focused on different
          stage of making a portfolio. We have separated the process of building a learning portfolio in two steps. The first one is recolting prints / prooves.
          The second one is to assemble this prints and to reflect on them to demonstrate a skills. At the end of the game jam, we end up with two prototypes,
          one for each step. The game for the first step was a card game based on game building mechanism. We begin the game with 5 'Time' cards which allow us to
          buy 'proofs of experiences'. We have later left this game because it was not fun to play because it was to close of the reality and also the lack of interaction
          between the player. <span class="highlight">The second game consited to assemble different cards to make the other players guess which skills did I own based on the prooves that I show.</span>
          At this time, this game had a lot of problems but we had see in it a potential. This event allow us to have an idea of what kind of game mechanism could work and which one will not work.

          After this game jam, we decided to work on the second prototype realised. The wanted message behind this game is : <span class="highlight">To demonstrate a skills, you need to show several relevant prooves.
          But it's not because the number of proves is high that the skill is well demonstrate. Indeed, show one relevant and good work piece is better than hundreds of bad works.</span>
          The biggest choice that we made was to make the game more abstract. We decided to avoid the terms 'proofs' and 'skills' which were to close of the learning portfolio universe.
          This choice allow us to create a new universe around the game, which will bring more fun to the game. But one of our fear was the loss of the message. To be sure that our games go
          into the good direction,<span class="highlight"> we prototype and test our game as often as possible.</span>>

          In january, we got the rule of Vestigium. At this time my role change, I was now in charge to create the illustration of the game. During one week, I have created nearly 20 cards. It was not
          enough to play but as our game rely a lot on illustration, we must tested the new card to know on which direction should I go and which card need improvement.
          <span class="highlight">During the test, we watch people play and we saw really fast that the game seems to easy because the cards were not abstract enough. At the end we ask to the players, what message do they pull out from the game and good news, they
          understand without any guidance the message that we want to deliver : " if we show the good combination of images, we find the word but one wrong images can totally change the understanding".</span>

          Today, it's to soon the see the impact of the game on the student portfolio because the game as only be tested on few voluntary students.
          Futhermore, the project is not finished yet. Indeed, an other game 'Skandal' is still in development.
